# Esports-Uni-League
Esports Uni League is a collegiate gaming organisation established in 2018. The website is wullstack and made by me

When creating this website I had two goals in my mind. Those were and still are good looking, well scaling and simple to use user UI.
Currently the website fully scales on all mobile devices and doesn't lose any functionality while doing so.

## Features on the website

### Login/Register system

The website offers fully fledged registering system. On top just registering and hacing sessions the moderators can decide who to accept and who to deny before you using the system based on their registration information.
 
### Ticket system

The ticket system made mainly to help users in trouble to have a quick way to get an answer from the staff.
