# Esports-Uni-League
Esports Uni League is a collegiate gaming organisation established in 2018. The website is fullstack and made by Audiovisuaali.

When creating this website I had two goals in my mind. Those two goals were and still are: good looking, well scaling and simple to use Web UI.
Currently the website fully scales on all mobile devices and doesn't lose any functionality while doing so.

Unfortunately I'm not allowed to share the code, but here are the main higlights from the website

## Features on the website

Before you take a look under the hood check out the website first and the sections that you can see as a visitor
